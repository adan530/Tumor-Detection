# Tumor-Detection
This repository contains the completion of Manual-1 Category B Task1 which is Brain Tumor Segmentation with YOLO 11 and SAM2
This project involves using advanced computer vision techniques to perform brain tumor segmentation using YOLO 11 and SAM2 models.
# Overview:
 • YOLO 11- A state-of-the-art real-time object detection model that identifies mul
tiple objects in an image with high speed and accuracy.
 • SAM2 (Segment Anything Model 2)- A segmentation model designed for precise
 object separation in an image.
 • Segmentation- The process of partitioning an image into meaningful regions to
 detect and analyze objects.
